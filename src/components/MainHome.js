                  I got my degree from Middle Georgia State University in 2018,
                  and moved to Colorado with my wife in 2019.

                <h4>A little more about me</h4>
                <p>
                  I have my most fun in the developmental realm working with ReactJS and C#. With these two items,
                  it seems more problems can find a solution in these languages. I am currently working with the
                  Department of Commerce on a few open source applications.

                <p>
                  Outside of code, I enjoy creating and supporting others that in other ways. From working on my blog,
                  to finding new music, or reading a new (to me) book, there is so much in the realm of creation and arts.
